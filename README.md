# QR-code-Full-algorithm
In this project I represented full algorithm of creating QR-code, for now it is a bit raw, but working. It can create qr-code from Latin capital/small letters and numbers up to 17 caracters. The program vna be started in terminal and later after creating you can check your QR-code image in folder. 

Check UP later for updates :)
